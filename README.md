Hi, I'm Adrian.

I am an undergraduate at UCLA studying computational biology on the bioinformatics track.

I'm interested in applying computational and quantitative methods to biological systems, particularly in imaging and genomics.

Currently building experience in:
- Biological and genomic understanding
- Data analysis
- Scientific computing
